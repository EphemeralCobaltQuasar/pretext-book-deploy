Note that , , where for . The theorem is therefore equivalent to the statement that every loop in based at is homotopic to for a unique . To prove this the idea will be to compare paths in with paths in via the  given by . This can be visualized geometrically by embedding in as the helix parametrized by , and then is the restriction to the helix of the projection of onto , . Observe that the loop is the composition where is the path , starting at 0 and ending at , winding around the helix times, upward if and downward if . The relation is expressed by saying that is a lift of .   lift      covering space   Given a space , a covering space of consists of a space and a  satisfying the following condition:  For each point there is an open neighborhood of in such that is a union of disjoint open sets each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto by .  Such a will be called evenly covered .     evenly covered   Given a space , a covering space of consists of a space and a  satisfying the following condition:  For each point there is an open neighborhood of in such that is a union of disjoint open sets each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto by .  Such a will be called evenly covered .     induced homomorphism   Suppose is a taking the basepoint to the basepoint . For brevity we write in this situation. Then induces a homomorphism , defined by composing loops based at with , that is, . This induced  is well-defined since a homotopy of loops based at yields a composed homotopy of loops based at , so . Furthermore, is a homomorphism since , both functions having the value for and the value for .  Two basic properties of induced homomorphisms are:  (1) for a composition .  (2) , which is a concise way of saying that the identity  induces the identity  .     free product   As a set, the free product  consists of all words of arbitrary finite length , where each letter belongs to a group and is not the identity element of , and adjacent letters and belong to different groups , that is, . Words satisfying these conditions are called reduced , the idea being that unreduced words can always be simplified to reduced words by writing adjacent letters that lie in the same as a single letter and by canceling trivial letters. The empty word is allowed, and will be the identity element of .     sheets   A covering space of a space is a space together with a  satisfying the following condition: Each point has an open neighborhood in such that is a union of disjoint open sets in , each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto by . Such a is called evenly covered and the disjoint open sets in that project homeomorphically to by are called sheets of over .     homotopy lifting property   The homotopy lifting property , also known as the covering homotopy property , states the following:   Given a covering space , a homotopy , and a  lifting , then there exists a unique homotopy of that lifts .     path lifting property   First we have the homotopy lifting property , also known as the covering homotopy property :   Proposition 1.30.  Given a covering space , a homotopy , and a  lifting , then there exists a unique homotopy of that lifts .    Proof: This was proved as property (c) in the proof of Theorem 1.7.  Taking to be a point gives the path lifting property for a covering space , which says that for each path and each lift of the starting point , there is a unique path lifting starting at .  In particular, the uniqueness of lifts implies that every lift of a constant path is constant, but this could be deduced more simply from the fact that has the discrete topology, by the definition of a covering space.     unique lifting property   Next we have the unique lifting property :   Proposition 1.34.  Given a covering space and a  , if two lifts of agree at one point of and is connected, then and agree on all of .      semilocally simply-connected   A necessary condition for to have a simply-connected covering space is the following: Each point has a neighborhood such that the inclusion-induced  is trivial; one says is semilocally simply-connected if this holds.     isomorphism between covering spaces   We are interested in uniqueness up to isomorphism, where an isomorphism between covering spaces and is a homeomorphism such that . This condition means exactly that preserves the covering space structures, taking to for each . The inverse is then also an isomorphism, and the composition of two isomorphisms is an isomorphism, so we have an equivalence relation.   Proposition 1.37. If is path-connected and locally path-connected, then two path-connected covering spaces and are isomorphic via an isomorphism taking a basepoint to a basepoint iff .     universal cover   A consequence of the lifting criterion is that a simply-connected covering space of a path-connected, locally path-connected space is a covering space of every other path-connected covering space of . A simply-connected covering space of is therefore called a universal cover . It is unique up to isomorphism, so one is justified in calling it the universal cover.     deck transformations   For a covering space the isomorphisms are called deck transformations or covering transformations . These form a group under composition.  For example, for the covering space projecting a vertical helix onto a circle, the deck transformations are the vertical translations taking the helix onto itself, so in this case. For the -sheeted covering space , the deck transformations are the rotations of through angles that are multiples of , so .     normal covering space   A covering space is called normal if for each and each pair of lifts of there is a deck transformation taking to . For example, the covering     group action   Given a group and a space , then an action of on is a homomorphism from to the group of all homeomorphisms from to itself. Thus to each is associated a homeomorphism ,     orbit space   Given an action of a group on a space , we can form a space , the space of in which each point is identified with all its images as ranges over . The points of are thus the orbits  in , and is called the orbit space of the action. For example, for a normal covering space , the orbit space is just .     orbit   Given an action of a group on a space , we can form a space , the space of in which each point is identified with all its images as ranges over . The points of are thus the orbits  in .     fixed points   The reason why the action of this group on fails to satisfy is that there are fixed points : points for which there is a nontrivial element with . For example, the vertices of the     free action   An action without fixed points is called a free action. Thus for a free action of on , only the identity element of fixes any point of . This is equivalent to requiring that all the images of each are distinct, or in other words only when , since is equivalent to . Though condition implies freeness, the converse     cayley graph   Covering spaces can be used to describe a very classical method for viewing groups geometrically as graphs. Recall from Corollary 1.28 how we associated to each group presentation a 2-dimensional cell complex with by taking a wedge-sum of circles, one for each generator , and then attaching a 2-cell for each relator . We can construct a cell complex with a covering space action of such that in the following way. Let the vertices of be the elements of themselves. Then, at each vertex , insert an edge joining to for each of the chosen generators . The resulting graph is known as the Cayley graph of with respect to the generators . This graph is connected since every element of is a product of 's, so there is a path in the graph joining each vertex to the identity vertex . Each relation determines a loop in the graph, starting at any vertex , and we attach a 2-cell for each such loop. The resulting cell complex is the Cayley complex of . The group acts on by multiplication on the left. Thus, an element sends a vertex to the vertex , and the edge from to is sent to the edge from to . The action extends to 2-cells in the obvious way. This is clearly a covering space action, and the orbit space is just .     cayley complex   Covering spaces can be used to describe a very classical method for viewing groups geometrically as graphs.

More general spaces are studied in 4.2. All these spaces are called Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, though in the case they were studied by Hurewicz before Eilenberg and MacLane took up the general case.
