<div class="para">Covering spaces can be used to describe a very classical method for viewing groups geometrically as graphs. Recall from Corollary 1.28 how we associated to each group presentation <span class="process-math">\(G = \langle g_{\alpha} \mid r_{\beta} \rangle\)</span> a 2-dimensional cell complex <span class="process-math">\(X_{G}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\pi_{1}(X_{G}) \approx G\)</span> by taking a wedge-sum of circles, one for each generator <span class="process-math">\(g_{\alpha}\text{,}\)</span> and then attaching a 2-cell for each relator <span class="process-math">\(r_{\beta}\text{.}\)</span> We can construct a cell complex <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{X}_{G}\)</span> with a covering space action of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{X}_{G} / G = X_{G}\)</span> in the following way. Let the vertices of <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{X}_{G}\)</span> be the elements of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> themselves. Then, at each vertex <span class="process-math">\(g \in G\text{,}\)</span> insert an edge joining <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(g g_{\alpha}\)</span> for each of the chosen generators <span class="process-math">\(g_{\alpha}\text{.}\)</span> The resulting graph is known as the <dfn class="terminology">Cayley graph</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> with respect to the generators <span class="process-math">\(g_{\alpha}\text{.}\)</span> This graph is connected since every element of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a product of <span class="process-math">\(g_{\alpha}\)</span>’s, so there is a path in the graph joining each vertex to the identity vertex <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> Each relation <span class="process-math">\(r_{\beta}\)</span> determines a loop in the graph, starting at any vertex <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> and we attach a 2-cell for each such loop. The resulting cell complex <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{X}_{G}\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">Cayley complex</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> The group <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> acts on <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{X}_{G}\)</span> by multiplication on the left. Thus, an element <span class="process-math">\(g \in G\)</span> sends a vertex <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> to the vertex <span class="process-math">\(g g'\text{,}\)</span> and the edge from <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(g' g_{\alpha}\)</span> is sent to the edge from <span class="process-math">\(g g'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(g g' g_{\alpha}\text{.}\)</span> The action extends to 2-cells in the obvious way. This is clearly a covering space action, and the orbit space is just <span class="process-math">\(X_{G}\text{.}\)</span><div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#cayleyComplex-2-1" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
